Prime factorization is an interesting problem as it is not efficiently solvable on a classical computer with any known algorithm. This fact is used in modern cryptograpy methods. In this thesis, a method based on simulated annealing will be examined. It could be shown that one factorization step can be done in polynomial time.

The thesis and the talk are written in German. You can find final versions in the [final](https://github.com/f-koehler/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/final) folder.

I am not very happy with the code of the programs I wrote, so I started the [primefac](https://github.com/f-koehler/primefac)-project. Go check it out!
